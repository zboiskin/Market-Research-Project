# Market-Research-Project
Optus is the second largest telecommunications company in Australia and is a fully owned
subsidiary of parent company Singtel. It’s mission statement is “breaking barriers and building
bonds to assist businesses and consumers communicate easier, faster, more economical and
reliable” (About Optus, 2015). Optus believes that creating and delivering value to its
customers, employees and shareholders is a fundamental part of its business.
In February 2015, Optus requested Marketing Research students of the University of
Technology Sydney to conduct research into the telecommunications industry to determine
the influence that entertainment content could play in the differentiation of Optus’ products
with regards to the target group being 18 to 24 year olds in Australia. A research question was
formulated in order to complete this assignment:
“How can Optus use the service of entertainment to improve their products and gain a
competitive advantage over rival companies in the market of 18 - 24
year olds?”
